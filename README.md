### Case summary


### Prerequisites
To run this project, you will need:
* IDE
* Python 3.x
* Google Cloud Platform account
* Docker
* AWS Access,Secret, log access and log secret keys
* .env file containing the AWS keys in the same directory as the airflow DAGs docker compose

```bash
python -m venv assgn4_venv
source assgn4_venv\bin\activate
```

### Process Flow
* Create a python virtual environment and activate
```bash
python -m venv assgn4_venv
```

* Activate the virtual environment
```bash
source env/bin/activate  # on Linux/macOS
env\Scripts\activate     # on Windows
```

* Install the required packages from requirements.txt file
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

* Run Streamlit app
```bash
streamlit run streamlit.py
```

### .env file for airflow:
- AWS_ACCESS_KEY = <AWS_ACCESS_KEY>
- AWS_SECRET_KEY = <AWS_SECRET_KEY>
- AWS_LOGS_ACCESS_KEY = <AWS_LOGS_ACCESS_KEY>
- AWS_LOGS_SECRET_KEY = <AWS_LOGS_SECRET_KEY>

### .env file for fastapi and streamlit:
- AWS_ACCESS_KEY = <AWS_ACCESS_KEY>
- AWS_SECRET_KEY = <AWS_SECRET_KEY>
- AWS_LOGS_ACCESS_KEY = <AWS_LOGS_ACCESS_KEY>
- AWS_LOGS_SECRET_KEY = <AWS_LOGS_SECRET_KEY>
